__Project Created: March 2016__  
Status: Unfinished, Never puhlished

## Tools
+ [MonoGame Engine](https://www.monogame.net/)

C# was the first programming language I learned and I used it to write games. This project is my first ever project. The game is simple but I learned a lot.

## Game Logic
+ The player is trapped inside a dungeon and must fight monsters coming out of the crack of the walls.

+ The player has a rifle and a grenade launcher. infinite ammo but also infinite enemies.
+ Each enemy killed will drop resources for you to collect.

+ With enough resources, you could build yourself shelter and turrets.

## Some highlights:
+ A* pathfinding algorithm for monsters.
+ Simple base building with walls and turrets.
+ Monster, turrets, bullets, explosion, animations, and walls are my hand drawings.
