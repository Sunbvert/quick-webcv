## Project Description
The project is created for the WeChat mini-game competition in 2019. The topic is to create games related to Chinese traditional culture.

We created a Yin-yang-themed music game. Players need to hit the halos when it emerges. Yin and Yang will move accordingly. 

A lot of animations and effects are used in this game. E.g. water wave effect, frosted glass effect.

The game randomly loads the next song if the player beats the current level until the game is over which happens if the player missed a certain percentage of beats. The game will get harder every level.

I lead a team of 4 to participate in the competition and won a 1000ï¿¥ reward.
