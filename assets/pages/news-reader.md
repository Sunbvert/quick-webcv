## Project Description
The app is created for my favorite morning news platform from WeChat. Every morning I read their news. I thought it's better if someone can read the news to me while I was getting up so it can save some of my time. I know some of the speech synthesis technology is quite good using AI.

I implemented the app with **Azure's cognitive API** and the result is very good. I then contacted the news platform and they are very happy to have it. I give the app exclusive to them for free because the Azure's cognitive service is free(only for small usage).

They are now providing morning news with audio for more than a year!
