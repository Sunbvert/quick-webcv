# Software & System Verification

a.k.a. Software Testing.

I was the lead of a team of 5 for the Software & System Verification course project.

The course is taught by Professor Zolt√°n Micskei, Lecturer of the Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group([ftsrg](https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en)) from BME.

## What I can do:
+ Formal Method using UPPAAL(Critical system testing).
+ Model-based testing using GraphWalker.
+ Code-based testing using Randoop(Testing code generation).
+ Software testing (unit test, integration test, regression test).
