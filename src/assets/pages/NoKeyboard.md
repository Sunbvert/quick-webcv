## Idea & Problem

- This input method uses a **circular keyboard**. Input is purely done by user swiping on the screen.  
- The input speed is the real drawback, it's hard to find a sweet spot that is good at both input speed and input accuracy.  
- Game controller may benefit  from using this kind of input method.
