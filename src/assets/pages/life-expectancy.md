## Project Description

This is a data visualization contest. we are provided JSON data of human life expectancy data of multiple countries from the year 1800 to 2015.

I teamed up with two of my classmate. I was the leader.

The application is basically one large canvas, we draw the map and the year slider on it. we use different visual elements to represent different features: color for GDP. The number of the human icons for population.

we also created a feature to predict life expectancy given the GDP number by using logarithm regression.
